Once you have Node.js installed, ensure you can run it from the terminal/command line by opening a console and executing the command 
```
node -v
``` 
If you see a version number appear on the next line, you have Node.js correctly installed.

Using the console, navigate to the directory where your project is stored. Execute the command
```
npm install
