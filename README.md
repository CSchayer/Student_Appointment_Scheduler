## Install

This application runs using Node.js. If you have not installed Node.js, download it [here] (https://nodejs.org/en/).

Once you have Node.js installed, ensure you can run it from the terminal/command line by opening a console and executing the command 
```
node -v
``` 
If you see a version number appear on the next line, you have Node.js correctly installed.

Using the console, navigate to the directory where your project is stored. Execute the command
```
npm install
```
This will install all the node modules needed for the project. These dependencies are listed in the package.json file.

Once the install has finished, execute the command
```
node app.js
```

This should produce the following output to the console
```
App listening on port 3000
```

The application is now running, and the home page can be reached by opening Google Chrome (*NOTE: This application was developed to run in Google Chrome. Proper functionality cannot be guaranteed in other browsers.*) and going to the URL localhost:3000.
